As i'm sure you will all agree, Javascript is a popular language at the moment. Every day there seems to be a some new Javascript framework cropping up and it's becoming hard to know what to use and when. As with all the new frameworks a lot more emphasis is being placed on using raw Javascript and needing to understand raw Javascript. So I am trying to make more of an effort to really get to grips with this wonderful not so little language. In most of the full time roles I have been part of, jQuery was for sure the leader of the javascript libraries. So that's what I have been mostly used to working with.

I think jQuery is a great tool, it really allowed us Front End Dev's to focus on building sites/apps without too much of the headache of writing cross browser compatible Javascript, especially if you had to support those legacy browsers (you know who they are).

Recently I have been shifting my focus from jQuery and more on writing raw Javascript. This is at times challenging and I can see clearly whey libraries such as jQuery were born. The one thing I find the most frustrating is when I need to find out how to do something with just Javascript. I do the usual google search and what do I get back? Information on how to perform what I need in, you guessed it, in jQuery

So I am going to start to document more about performing common tasks with just Javascript and not jQuery to help me learn and hopefully others when in development.
