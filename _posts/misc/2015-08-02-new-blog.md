So, it's been a little while since I wrote a post but you know, busy busy as ever with other projects and various contracts. I have however updated my blog. As well as a new design I have moved over to a static site generator called Jekyll and added the ability to comment using Disqus.

As from a previous post I created my original blog just using a template engine calld swig and gulp to process all my assets. This was fine but was proving a little hard to create new posts as it was too much of a manual process.

I investigated various static site generators but decided to go with Jekyll due to it's maturity, flexibility, the template engine and I could stick with Sass. Not to mention the great support and articles out there.

Overall i'm pretty impressed with Jekyll and happy with my choice.

For the build I built the stie statically using my usual favourite tools:

- Swig
- Sass
- Gulp
- Sublime Text 3
- Now built on my Macbook pro

Once the site was built and tested, I then moved over to Jekyll. As as I created the HTML partials in swig the convertion was easy pesy.

There are lots of static site generators available now, if you looking to use one take some time to do some investigation to make sure you choose the righ one for your needs.

Please feel free to comment and stir up some discussions.

Heppy coding!
