So, it's been a little while since I wrote a post but I have been as busy as ever with other projects and various contracts. I have however found some time to updated my blog. As well as a new design I have moved over to a static site generator called Jekyll and added the ability to comment using Disqus.

As from a previous post I created my original blog just using a template engine called swig and gulp to process all my assets. This was fine but was proving a little hard to create new posts as it was too much of a manual process.

I investigated various static site generators but decided to go with Jekyll due to it's maturity, flexibility, template engine and I could stick with Sass. Not to mention the great support and articles out there.

Overall i'm pretty impressed with Jekyll and happy with my choice.

For the build I built the site statically using my usual favorite tools:

- Swig
- Sass
- Gulp
- Sublime Text 3
- Now built on my Macbook pro

Once the site was built and tested, I then moved over to Jekyll. As as I created the HTML partials in Swig templates and Jekyll uses Liquid templates which are near on identical, the conversion was easy pesy.

There are lots of static site generators available now, if you looking to use one take some time to do some investigation to make sure you choose the right one for your needs.

Please feel free to comment and stir up some discussions.

Happy coding!
