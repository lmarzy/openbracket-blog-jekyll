Modules in JS are a very welcome addition, meaning we can re-organise our files into easy to consume components, this is not fully supported in all browsers so make sure you run your code through a transpiler to output the required file to include in your page.

You were probably introduced to modules if you have done any work with Node using module.exports and require etc.

Now ES2015 has introduced this to use in the browser, lets check it out.

Lets say we have a sum function, this function takes 2 parameters and returns us the sum of these:

{% highlight javascript %}
function sum(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}
console.log(sum(10, 20)); // 30
{% endhighlight %}

Pretty simple stuff right, now lets move this function into it's own file:

{% highlight javascript %}
// sum.js

function sum(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

export { sum };
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight javascript %}
// main.js

import { sum } from './sum';
console.log(sum(10, 20)); // 30
{% endhighlight %}

We can in-fact export multiple functions/values from one file:

{% highlight javascript %}
// sum.js

function sumA(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

function sumB(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}

export { sumA, sumB };
{% endhighlight %}

And then consume the functions as follows:

{% highlight javascript %}
// main.js

import { sumA, sumB } from './sum';

console.log(sumA(10, 20)); // 30
console.log(sumB(10, 20, 30)); // 60
{% endhighlight %}

Really nice I think you will agree. There are a few variations to the export and import though, lets take a look at exporting:

{% highlight javascript %}
// sum.js

export function sumA(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

export function sumB(x, y, z) {
  return x + y + z;
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see we can use the export keyword directly on the function/value that we are exporting, lets take a look at varying ways of importing:

{% highlight javascript %}
// main.js

import {
  sumA as addTwoNumbers,
  sumB as addThreeNumbers
} from './sum';

console.log(addTwoNumbers(10, 20)); // 30
console.log(addTwoNumbers(10, 20, 30)); // 60
{% endhighlight %}

We can setup and alias for each import, another way is to import everything as one:

{% highlight javascript %}
// main.js

import * as addition from './sum';

console.log(addition.sumA(10, 20)); // 30
console.log(addition.sumB(10, 20, 30)); // 60
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see when importing as a whole you need to alias the import, which gives us an object with the exported items being part of that and then reference the export from the new object.

As you can see the ES2015 modules are a great addition, making it much easier to organise you code base and test.

Enjoy!
