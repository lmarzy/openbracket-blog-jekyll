With gulp version > 3.9, you can now use ES2015 in your gulpfile, this is thanks to the popular Babel transpiler.

Firstly make sure you have version 3.9 or later of the Gulp CLI and local version, open the terminal and type:

{% highlight console %}
gulp -v
{% endhighlight %}

If you are in a directory with gulp installed you should get the CLI and local version returned:

{% highlight console %}
CLI version 3.9.1
Local version 3.9.1
{% endhighlight %}

If you have a version lower than 3.9, you will need to get these updated. The following should help with this:

You can run an 'npm update', this will update all out of date packages, to update a single package you can run 'npm update [package]' and to update globally installed packages you can run 'npm update -g [package]'.

So to update gulp locally and globally run:

Locally
{% highlight console %}
npm update gulp
{% endhighlight %}

Globally
{% highlight console %}
npm update -g gulp
{% endhighlight %}

Once you have the correct version of Gulp you then need to install babel, this needs to be dependency of your project along with the es2015 preset:

{% highlight console %}
npm install babel-core babel-preset-es2015 --save-dev
{% endhighlight %}

Once installed you need to configure the Babel to use the preset option, this can be added to either a new file .bablerc or package.json

You can create a new file in the root of your project and call it .babelrc and add the followign to the new file:

{% highlight console %}
{
  "presets": ["es2015"]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Or add the following to your package.json file:

{% highlight console %}
"babel": {
  "presets": ["es2015"]
}
{% endhighlight %}

Then all that is left is to instruct Gulp to use Babel, this is achieved by renaming the gulpfile.js file to.

{% highlight console %}
gulpfile.babel.js
{% endhighlight %}

There you have it, you can now use ES0215 for your Gulp file: An example of a gulpfile.babel.js might now look like this:

{% highlight console %}
'use strict';

import gulp form 'gulp';

const dirs = {
  src: 'src',
  build: 'build'
}

gulp.task('js', () => {
  ...
});
{% endhighlight %}
