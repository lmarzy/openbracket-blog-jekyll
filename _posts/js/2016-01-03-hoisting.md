So lets talk about Hoisting, sounds simple enough from the definition which is 'raise up, lift up' etc.. but what does it really mean when it comes to JavaScript. When I initially read about it I though OK that makes sense, when I declare a variable or function in my code it will get moved to the top so if I am in the global execution and I declare a variable or function below some other code the variable will be moved to the top of the file to be available.

This simple definition turns out is not quite accurate.

Lets consider this example:

{% highlight javascript %}
var a = 'Variable Hi!';

function b() {
  console.log('Function Hi!');
}

console.log(a);
b();
{% endhighlight %}

If we inspect this code in the browser console we get:

{% highlight javascript %}
Variable Hi!
Function Hi!
{% endhighlight %}

OK, this is what I would expect so lets change the code up a little:

{% highlight javascript %}
console.log(a);
b();

var a = 'Variable Hi!';

function b() {
  console.log('Function Hi!');
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now based on the above definition of Hoisting we would expect the same results as our variables and functions would be moved to the top of the file but we actually get:

{% highlight javascript %}
undefined
Function Hi!
{% endhighlight %}

So why is this, why do we get the functions code as we expect but the variable is undefined? As we tried to log the value of 'a' before it was created we my also expect to get an error as a does not exist at this point but as we get 'undefined' this indicates 'a' is being set to a value 'undefined'.

If we tried to reference 'a' without declaring it at all this is what we get back:

{% highlight javascript %}
Uncaught ReferenceError: a is not defined
{% endhighlight %}

So what is actually happening: When JavaScript reads the file it actually makes two passes at the code, this first pass (creation phase) goes through the code looking for variables and functions and puts them into memory, the entire function is put into memory but all JavaScript does with variables is set aside the memory space and Set's it's value to, you guessed it 'undefined', please note this is not the the string 'undefined' but the actual JavaScript value of 'undefined'.

When we go back to the above code this is how you could think of it on the creation phase:

The function 'b' is placed into memory and the variable a is declared and memory space put aside ready for the actual value but initially it's value is set to 'undefined' until the code is actually executed on the second pass.

{% highlight javascript %}
function b() {
  console.log('Function Hi!');
}

var a = undefined

console.log(a);
b();
{% endhighlight %}

Once this first pass over the code is complete the code is then executed (execution phase) so as the function is all in memory we get the desired results but as a is declared and set to 'undefined' we get the value back of 'undefined'.

Lets look at one more example so we can fully understand this;

{% highlight javascript %}
function b() {
  console.log('Called b!');
}

b();
console.log(a);

var a = 'Hello World!';

console.log(a);
{% endhighlight %}

What would you expect the above code to output?

Lets break it down:

Creation phase: JavaScript goes through the code and puts functions into memory and sets aside memory space for variables setting the values to undefined. So function 'b' will be placed into memory and variable 'a' will be set to 'undefined'.

Execution phase: JavaScript will then commence with the execution of the code which will execute the 'b' function (b()) and log 'called b' to the console then it will console.log 'a' which at this point is set to 'undefined' and then it will actually set 'a' to the string value of 'Hello World!' and finally it will log the actual value of 'a' which is 'Hello World!' to the console.

There you have it, a more in-depth look at Hoisting, as this can catch you out it's always better to declare values and functions at the top of the code. This makes code easier to read and can prevent any surprises cropping up.
