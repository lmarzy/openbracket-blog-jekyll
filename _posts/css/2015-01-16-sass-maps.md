Sass introduced a new data type in version 3.3 called map. While you may be unfamiliar with this name you may have come across maps in other languages, usually referred as associative arrays and are very similar to JSON. Lets take a look at what a Sass map looks like

So just like JSON, maps use colons to map keys to values and commas to separate the key/value pairs. Instead of braces though brackets are used.


{% highlight css %}
$maps: (
  key1: value1,
  key2: value2,
  key3: value3,
  key4: value4
);
{% endhighlight %}

Things to note:

- The colon on the last key/value pair is optional
- Keys must be unique but can be anything, even null
- The keys can be any sass type, including lists and other maps
- Functions are a very handy way work with maps

Like I said earlier, maps are great for project configuration and this is exactly what I have begun to do with them, lets look at an example of a map and how to use it.

I currently use maps for my colours, media-queries and z-index. Lets use colours as an example.

Basic colour map:

{% highlight css %}
$colours: (
  a: #669999,
  b: #006699,
  c: #FFCC99
);
{% endhighlight %}

Now to use the colour you can use the function map-get:

{% highlight css %}
.class {
  background-color: map-get($colors, a);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Now the above is a little long to type and will soon become tiresome typing map-get over and over. This is where a function can help:

{% highlight css %}
@function colour($key) {
  @return map-get($colors, $key);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Using the new function is easy:

{% highlight css %}
.class {
  background-color: colour(a);
}
{% endhighlight %}

As stated above maps can contain further nested maps, this is great if you want finer control of your data but unfortunately there is no way to access nested maps through the built-in API apart from duplicating the map-get code:

{% highlight css %}
background-color: map-get(map-get($colors, alerts), info);
{% endhighlight %}

This code is not too pretty and I dont like repeating nature of it. Fortunately there is a fairly easy solution, of course using a function and loop:

{% highlight css %}
@function map-nested($map, $keys...) {
  @each $key in $keys {
    $map: map-get($map, $key);
  }
 
  @return $map;
}
{% endhighlight %}

So lets update the above colours map, this is a cut down version of how I actually handle colours:

{% highlight css %}
$colours: (
  brand: (
    a:        #669999,
    b:        #006699,
    c:        #FFCC99
    ),
  alerts: (
    info:     #5D60F0,
    warn:     #DEE34F,
    error:    #ED5C6B,
    success:  #7FE381
  )
);
{% endhighlight %}

So to use the new function to get a deeply nested map simply use:

{% highlight css %}
background-color: map-nested($colours, alerts, info);
{% endhighlight %}

So there you have it, a quick overview of using maps. Obviously this is only scratching the surface and there is lots more to learn but as with everything, start using what you think would be useful to you right now and build up your knowledge.
