What do we mean when we say JavaScript types? Simply put it is the types of data that a variable can hold.

JavaScript is rather special when it comes to types, with most other languages when you declare a variable you have to state what type that variable will hold, called static typing but with JavaScript you don't. This is called dynamic typing, meaning you don't tell the engine what type of data a variable holds, this is figured out while the code is running. This means that a variable can hold different types of data, you could declare this:

{% highlight javascript %}
var a = 'string'  // type of string
a = 10 // type of number
{% endhighlight %}

javascript is quite happy with the above code and no errors will be produced.

So what are the types of data you can store in variables?

There are primitive types - this means a type of data that represents a single value. There are 6 primitive types we can work with:

-undefined
-null
-boolean
-number
-string
-symbol - introduced in ES6

The other data type is object which can be seen as a collection of properties, objects include:

-function
-array
-Date
-RegExp
